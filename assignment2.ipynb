    "\n",
    "In this week's assignment you'll gain experience applying different clustering methods, computing cluster labels, and selecting an optimal number of clusters based on quality assessment metrics. In addition, you'll gain experience working with working with text data. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll continue to use the \"beer\" dataset, but this time focused more on the *text* of beer reviews. In the \"bag of words\" scenario, each review is represented by a sparse vector that's filled in according to which specific terms are found in that review. (As a reminder, we generally use \"term\" to refer to a word or phrase that's part of a text representation - since as you'll see below, when working with text it's very useful to work with phrases as features as well as individual words.) In particular, we'll treat single terms and two-term bigrams (phrases) as features here. You'll apply a simple Vectorizer to process the text, which will also be a useful prelude to next week's upcoming assignment on topic models. To familiarize yourself with how a text passage can be represented as a vector of word counts or weights, the \"bag of words\" model, *please read Sec. 7.3-7.5 in the textbook*. \n",

    "A big problem in applying $K$-means (and many other unsupervised clustering-type methods) is that we need to specify the number of clusters $K$ in advance - but we don't know in advance what value of $K$ will give the best-quality clustering!  So, to pick the \"best\" number of clusters we're going to rely on calculating some automated measures of cluster quality. You'll compute these cluster quality measures for each choice of $K$, and then pick the value of $K$ that gives the best value of the quality measure(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "We seen a few ways to assess cluster quality, including the silhouette score, but we're going to try out two alternative cluster quality measures that you should be aware of. They reward different ideas of \"quality\" for a clustering, but like the silhouette score, do not require ground-truth labels to compute quality (which is good, because we don't have them). These two measures are:\n",

    "\n",
    "We're looking for clusterings that have a *high* Calinski-Harabasz index, but a *low* Davies-Bouldin score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay - here's what you need to do for Question 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get the vectorized reviews using the get_beer_reviews_vectorized() function as shown below. For speed reasons we will only analyze a sample of 5000 reviews and not the whole set. The vectorized reviews will be output to the matrix X, which should have 5000 rows (one per review) and 1000 columns (one per word/term in the vocabulary produced by the vectorizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each choice of K from 2 to 9, run k-means clustering on these reviews. For each K, compute the above two cluster quality scores on the resulting clustering. IMPORTANT: You won't be including the code to run the whole loop in your autograded code submission: you're just trying to find the optimal value for $K$ for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT: *when running KMeans, set init='k-means++', max_iter=100, n_init=1, and random_state=42.*\n",
    "\n",
    "After you perform your clustering run in Step 2, you should see there's one clearly superior choice for K that gives the best value for both metrics (high Calinski-Harabasz score, low Davies-Bouldin score). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now you will write your assignment code that does a single clustering using that optimal K, and finds what the predominant terms are in the resulting clusters.  Remember, each cluster is a collection of vectors, each of which represents a beer review. To find good representative terms for each cluster, you want to know what the \"typical\" review looks like for each of the K clusters. A \"typical\" review for a cluster is just the mean of all the vectors (reviews) that belong to that cluster. This vector is known as the cluster centroid or center. *Note that when you run K-Means you don't have to compute the cluster centers yourself -- they are computed for you by K-Means after you run 'fit'. Just use the resulting cluster_centers_ property.*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The cluster center, since it's a just the mean of a bunch of review vectors, is itself just a vector of the same dimension as the input review vectors: think of the cluster center vector like a \"word cloud\" that holds the weight of each possible word in a review. So to get the most predominant terms in a vector, just sort the entries of the cluster centroid *from highest to lowest term weight*, and return the corresponding term strings. *You can do this sorting with one line of code, on all the cluster centers simultaneously, by applying argsort(..) to the cluster_centers_ array.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the list of top-weighted terms that come out for each cluster: do they look reasonable? Are the terms in each cluster similar in some way to each other? (We will revisit these terms in the next question.)  Remember that you can get the term strings that correspond to the review vector entries by using the vectorizer's get_feature_names() method.  *You can use the `print_cluster_features` example code above for reference on how to do this.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "Your function should return a list that has $K$ elements, where $K$ is the optimal number of clusters you found above. Each of these $K$ elements should itself contain a list of the top 10 terms (strings) for that cluster. These terms should be sorted by highest to lowest term weight value as stored in the cluster centroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you submit your solution using the parameters we supplied, we encourage you to play with different values for the parameters of TfidfVectorizer, to see how the results change, because the results of this kind of clustering can be very sensitive to those parameters, which control how the text is processed, what defines what a \"term\" is, and which words are kept as features in the clustering."

    "\n",
    "It was fun to extract the words in the 'typical' review for each cluster using the cluster centroid. However, you may have noticed that some words were duplicated across clusters and weren't that specific to a single cluster. For example 'nice' and 'like' appear in more than one 'typical' review, which makes sense given that reviews express opinions no matter which cluster a brew might appear in.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we'd like to find slighly better representative words for each cluster that are somewhat *specific* to that cluster and not others, i.e. words that distinguish reviews in that cluster from reviews in other clusters. To use the technical term, we want terms that are *discriminative* with respect to the clusters, not just descriptive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in dimensionality reduction we saw information gain (IG) as a feature selection criterion: it helps find features that distinguish one class from another class, improving prediction accuracy. Even though we don't have labels, we can use the same idea to find terms that are *special* to that cluster, that distinguish that cluster from the others. These IG-based distinctive terms will be our new cluster \"summary\". \n",

To do this, we're going to compute how surprised we are at the distribution $T_w$ of a word $w$ between this cluster vs all other clusters, compared to the distribution $T_c$ of the average word between this cluster $c$ and all clusters. If a word is a lot more likely to occur in this cluster than we would expect by chance, it is considered a more distinctive word for this cluster. This surprise factor is *information gain*.  Please see the link to the mini-lecture on information gain here: Starting @ 38:15 https://www.coursera.org/learn/siads542/lecture/y6wx8/recording-of-siads-542-office-hour-with-kevyn-collins-thompson-on-21-01-28-10-58\n",

Each of these outcomes has a probability when we're talking about where words occur. Thus, $T_c$ is a numpy array of shape (2, ). For example, suppose we pick a word from the vocabulary at random and find that on average, $T_c$ = [0.25, 0.75]. In other words, the chance on average that a word occurs in this cluster $c$ is 25%, and the chance of occurring in any other cluster is 75%.\n",

This is the provided function `one_vs_all_count_matrix`. As input, you provide the matrix $L$ along with the row $c$ you want to analyze. The output is a \"one versus all\" matrix $M$ that has shape (2, 1000): the first row has the weights of words in *this* cluster $c$ (which is the same as L[c, :]), and the second row has the aggregate summed weights of the words across all *other* clusters.  The columns are the same as $L$: one column per term in the vocabulary.\n",

    "### Question 3. Hierarchical clustering (25 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're going to use the beer names that correspond with the reviews to do a little hierarchical beer clustering according to their review similarity (based on the bag of words model used in the first question).\n",
    "\n",
    "We're actually going to rely on scipy for this question: specifically, scipy.cluster.hierarchy and its functions `ward(.)` and `dendrogram(.)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the cluster-term matrix returned by the vectorizer is sparse. However, we need a dense array to use the ward() function, so we densify the array, i.e. cls = ward(X.toarray())\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure returned by `ward` contains the linkage structure computed by the bottom-up, agglomerative clustering, and looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`[[ 7.     8.     0.947  2.   ]\n",
    "  [ 0.     1.     1.111  2.   ]\n",

    "Let's call this structure table `T`. It describes a tree, where each node of the tree has a unique integer called its \"node index\".  The columns of `T` are:\n",
    "- node index of first child\n",
    "- node index of second child\n",
    "- cluster distance at which the clusters were merged\n",
    "- number of instances in the resulting new cluster, after the merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's useful to understand and be able to compute things with this structure if needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "A cluster with a node index of less than N corresponds to a leaf node at the bottom of the tree, i.e. one of the original observations: the original data instances have node indexes of 0 through N-1 where N is the total number of instances (data points). They are considered to be in their own 1-instance cluster and are not included in `T`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In row i of `T`, two clusters with node indices T[i, 0] and T[i, 1] are combined to form a new cluster with node index N + i. \n",
    "The cluster algorithm's computed distance (e.g. Ward's distance) between clusters T[i, 0] and T[i, 1] is given by T[i, 2]. \n",
    "The fourth column value T[i, 3] represents the number of original observations (leaf nodes) that are in the newly formed cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree corresponding to this structure, with all node indices labeled, is shown here:\n",

    "Okay - here's what you need to do for this question. The goal is to compare how the large clusters found by hierarchical clustering compare with the ones you found using k-means clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1.** Call `(X, vectorizer, review_instances) = get_beer_reviews_vectorized(1000, (1,2), 1000)` to get the review-term matrix of sparse vectors corresponding to the first 1000 reviews in the dataset (and using the top 1000 bigram terms by frequency).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2.** Use the scipy wards method to cluster the instances in X.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3.** Use the resulting hierarchical cluster tree to get the reviews that fall into each of K clusters, where K = 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to do this question is to use the \"fcluster\" function that's part of the scipy.cluster.hierarchy package.\n",
    "See https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.hierarchy.fcluster.html\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use the 'maxclust' option of fcluster to automatically find the merge distance threshold that splits the reviews into K clusters and returns the cluster label of each review.  Use K = 2 for the results you submit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4a** Write a loop that, for each cluster you found in Step 3, does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4b**  Use the loop index 0, 1, ... as the cluster ID. Within the loop, filter the results of `fcluster` to find only the instances that belong to the given cluster ID.  Recall that the numpy \"where\" function can return you the indices of an array that meet your condition (such as which cluster index an instance has). You can then use these indices to select all elements with a given cluster ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4c.** Next within the loop, call the `compute_centroid` function to compute a centroid for the elements you found in Step 4b: the result will be a 'typical' review for that cluster -- essentially, a \"term cloud\" for that cluster's reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4d.** Next within the loop, find the top FIVE terms in the centroid having the *highest* weight (sorted by descending weight), and save the strings for those terms in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5.** Outside the loop, your function should return a list that contains TWO term lists (strings) corresponding to the K=2 clusters. Each term list should contain the top *five* terms in the cluster centroid you computed (sorted by highest to lowest term weight).\n"

    "### Question 4. Clustering with mixed feature types and cluster representatives. (25 points) \n",
    "\n",
    "The classic version of k-means assumes squared Euclidean distance. This assumption is used when the cluster representatives $m_k$ are assumed to be the means of the currently assigned cluster members. This is fine if all the features/variables are continuous values where taking the mean over them makes sense. However, there are many situations where we have a mixture of feature types, including categorical or ordinal features, where computing a mean doesn't make sense. In these cases, we must consider a more general version of k-means, based on an arbitrary dissimilarity function $D(x_i, x_j)$ between items that is used to compute the optimal cluster representatives $m_k$ (instead of a mean). One widely-used example of this is *k-medoids clustering*, which finds an existing item in the cluster that has minimum total distance to the other points in the cluster. (Even more generally, we can define a clustering algorithm just using proximity matrices of items, if they are available, and not even computing cluster centers: just keeping the item index of the cluster representative.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going use k-medoids for this question - but scikit-learn doesn't yet have a k-medoids implementation, so we're going to use a package called sklearn-extra, which is installed for you in the unsupervised learning Coursera environment. Note that k-medoid is computationally expensive: a naive implementation is quadratic in its runtime requirements (in $n$, the number of data instances) although more clever implementations can reduce that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem this question deals with is how to do clustering when your data has a mix of feature types. We solve this here by computing a generalized form of distance between instances called the *Gower distance.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a summary of how Gower distance is computed:  For each variable type, pick a distance that scales 0 to 1, then take a linear combination of these distance based on user-specified weights.\n",
    " \n",
    "For quantative (interval) variables: use manhattan distance.\n",
    "For ordinal variables: rank or manhattan distances, with special adjustment for ties.\n",
    "For nominal variables: variables of k categories are converted to one-hot encoding (k binary columns) and compared using the Dice coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
